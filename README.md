## Overview

The `oil-git.nvim` plugin enhances the functionality of [oil.nvim](https://github.com/stevearc/oil.nvim) by integrating Git status information directly into your file explorer. It visually represents the status of your files through color coding and symbols, making it easier to manage your Git projects.

## Features

- **File Name Highlighting**: This feature colors file names based on their Git status, allowing you to quickly identify modified, untracked, or staged files.

- **Status Symbols**: Each file displays a Git symbol at the end of its name, providing a clear visual cue of its current state.

- **Real-Time Updates**: The plugin automatically refreshes the file status when changes occur in your Git repository, ensuring you always see the latest information.

- **Performance Optimized**: Unlike other solutions, `oil-git.nvim` does not rely on caching. It fetches the current Git status directly, providing fresh updates without delay.

- **LazyGit Integration**: When you close LazyGit or other Git tools, `oil-git.nvim` instantly updates the file status, keeping your workspace in sync.

## Installation

### Using LazyVim/lazy.nvim

You can easily install `oil-git.nvim` with LazyVim or lazy.nvim. No additional setup is required.

```lua
{
  "benomahony/oil-git.nvim",
  dependencies = { "stevearc/oil.nvim" },
  -- No opts or config needed! Works automatically
}
```

### Optional Configuration

If you want to customize the appearance of the file status, you can add optional configuration as follows:

```lua
{
  "benomahony/oil-git.nvim",
  dependencies = { "stevearc/oil.nvim" },
  opts = {
    highlights = {
      OilGitModified = { fg = "#ff0000" }, -- Custom colors
    }
  }
}
```

### Installation with Other Plugin Managers

If you prefer a different plugin manager, follow the general instructions for your chosen manager. Make sure to include the dependency on `oil.nvim` for `oil-git.nvim` to function properly.

## Usage

Once installed, `oil-git.nvim` will automatically start displaying Git status in your file explorer. You can navigate through your files as usual, and the plugin will highlight them based on their status. 

### File Status Indicators

- **Modified Files**: These files will be highlighted in a specified color, indicating that changes have been made.
  
- **Untracked Files**: New files that are not yet tracked by Git will have a different color, helping you to identify them quickly.

- **Staged Files**: Files that are ready to be committed will also be indicated with a unique color or symbol.

## Customization Options

You can customize various aspects of `oil-git.nvim` to fit your workflow. Here are some examples:

### Color Customization

You can change the colors used for different file statuses in the configuration options. Here‚Äôs how you can set custom colors:

```lua
{
  "benomahony/oil-git.nvim",
  dependencies = { "stevearc/oil.nvim" },
  opts = {
    highlights = {
      OilGitModified = { fg = "#ff0000" }, -- Modified files
      OilGitUntracked = { fg = "#00ff00" }, -- Untracked files
      OilGitStaged = { fg = "#0000ff" }, -- Staged files
    }
  }
}
```

### Status Symbols

You can also customize the symbols used for different statuses. This allows you to tailor the appearance to your preferences.

```lua
{
  "benomahony/oil-git.nvim",
  dependencies = { "stevearc/oil.nvim" },
  opts = {
    symbols = {
      modified = "‚úèÔ∏è",  -- Custom symbol for modified files
      untracked = "üåü",  -- Custom symbol for untracked files
      staged = "‚úÖ",     -- Custom symbol for staged files
    }
  }
}
```

1. **Check Dependencies**: Ensure that `oil.nvim` is installed and correctly set up. `oil-git.nvim` relies on it for functionality.
